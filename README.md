# Pentest-Report
This is the final report for the simulated penetration test that I performed over the course of three days for the cybersecurity certification program through the University of Texas at Austin. Through this experience, I was able to demonstrate an understanding of a wide array of vulnerabilities on web applications, Linux, and Windows, as well as mitigation stratagies for these vulnerabilities.
